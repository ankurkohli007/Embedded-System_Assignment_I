## Abstract ##

This assignemnt report is about the **Embedded Systems** in which the of ***timers, interrupts, SPI, UART,*** and so on to determine about the operations performance. The specific goal in this case is that to know the implementation of operations with the real-time hardware. This report to bring the light on Embedded Systems for operations. Furthermore, the purpose of this report is to provide the approaches used during the development of code and implementation on microcontroller board. For this assignment, ***MPLAB IDE Software, XC16 Compiler and Microchip Microcontroller Board, HTerm serial software*** is used and also ***Embedded C programming*** is platform for the development of code.
